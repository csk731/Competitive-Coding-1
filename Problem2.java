// Question:
// A Min-Heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is smaller than or equal to 
// the values in the children of that node. Mapping the elements of a heap into an array is trivial: 
// if a node is stored an index k, then its left child is stored at index 2k + 1 and its right child at index 2k + 2.


class Problem2 {

    private static void minHeap()
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int arr[] = {};

    }
}
